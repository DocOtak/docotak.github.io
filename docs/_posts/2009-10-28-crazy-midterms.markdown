<p>Yesterday was my first oceanography midterm, for which I was studying for most of the past week and weekend. Hence my lack of posting for a while. Now that it is done, I can relax a little bit. Despite the intensity of my exams and... stuff, I'm not above enjoying the enviornment I'm living in right now.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Here is a photo I snapped (3 exposures) yesterday walking back from the exam to where I'm living on campus.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;dailyphoto&#47;DSC_9766_7_8_tonemapped.jpg" height="330px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>I have a five hour lab today where I will be going offshore to take some (rather expensive) water sample for analysis.<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
