<p>Last night was pretty crazy. Here is a short list of the awesome weather we had (and the consequences): rain (strong), wind (light), lightning (bright), thunder (loud), waterspouts (spouting), electrical power (none). Despite the distractions and the lack of power for a good while, I was able to get my assignments completed without issue. I also managed to record some of the thunder. This is not a real time recording, rather a compilation of the thunder I did manage to record.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
