<p>So I've been back in Hawaii for about a week now and the new term has started. This semester I am taking General Oceanography 1, Calc 1, Music 1000, and Geology 1000. I had the weekend before term to get in some recreation.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009Surfing_Waikiki&#47;CIMG1556.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;>That's me in the blue!<br &#47;>Since class has just started, not much has happened in them yet. My first field lab is next Wednesday, I'll definitely write about what I'm doing there.<br &#47;>I've just been busy moving in (I'm staying in the HPU Res Halls again) and getting back into the groove of my academics. On the subject of academics... I had better get back to them.<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
