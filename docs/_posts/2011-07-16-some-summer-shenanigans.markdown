<h4>Scripps<&#47;h4>So what have I been up to this summer? Working at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They have me doing some coding tasks and other things. Perhaps the best personal development is my new usage of VIM. I was always scared of VIM as I never could figure out how to reliably exit the program (C-c doesn't work). I've spent maybe two weeks using it and I'm hooked. Goodbye textmate.<br />
<h4>Cute Infestation<&#47;h4>Scripps has a problem, an adorable problem. For a while the bathrooms in the building I was in were inaccessible (they still are, I just moved buildings). So to go to the bathroom, I would need to walk across the "historic park" of Scripps. This is a large grassy area with some old cottages. While walking, bunnies and squirrels and chipmunks would all be scurrying away from me. So many that I would check to see that I wasn't in a Disney movie.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;IMG_0345.jpg" &#47;><br />
<h4>The Beach Crowds<&#47;h4>Being so close to the ocean, I sometimes go to the beach durring breaks as work. And well, the crowds... just look at them!<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;IMG_0375.jpg" &#47;><br &#47;>And that isn't even the CROWDED part of the beach! I mean, I've never seen it this crowded in Hawaii, well maybe one, at Waimea, durring the Eddie... My working posit is that because we had such a lousy summer last year in San Diego, people are flocking to the beach due to awesomeness...ness.<br />
<h4>Office Move<&#47;h4>My group recently moved offices due to construction. Look what showed up on the whiteboard...<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;IMG_0378.jpg" &#47;><br &#47;>It has gotten more elaborate since I took this photo, and more nerdy...<br &#47;><br &#47;>That's all for now!<br &#47;>-Barna</p>
