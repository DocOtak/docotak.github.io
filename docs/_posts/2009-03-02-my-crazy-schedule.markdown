<p>I use a calendar program to map out what I'm doing during the week and this is one of those weeks where everything seemed to converge. Not a problem, I've dealt with it before. Bellow you can see my schedule for the week, it looks more intimidating than it actually is. The most important things are in green, which is class time. In blue are other commitments and what I think I should be studying at that moment, more as a reminder to me. Purple is the schedule of the library and orange is dining times.<br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26120&g2_serialNumber=1" target="_blank"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26123&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
