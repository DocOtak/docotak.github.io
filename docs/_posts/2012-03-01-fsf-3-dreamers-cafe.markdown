I've walked by this place several times wondering if it is  any good. 
Finally I go in and see whats what, especially considering that I've
seen quite a crowd inside the place. Just based on the menu always 
posted outside, I figured it was more of a local food place.

The cafe itself is located on the corner of Fort Street and some other 
street I don't know the name of, right across from subway and the 1132 
Bishop building. Given that it was a more local place, I ordered a 
loco moco.

The eggs were awesome, nice and runny, just how I like them. You may 
also notice that there are onions on it as well, a nice touch, 
especially because they were nice and crunchy.

The loco moco was not quite what I expected from one. While I probably 
won't go back to the cafe, they clearly have something to offer, as the 
place filled completely while I was eating the food. Perhaps I just 
chose the wrong thing, maybe it was just an off day. They have a bunch 
of breakfast foods on the menu like pancakes and stuff, I'm guessing 
that Dreamer's would be the place to be for some breakfast awesome.

My verdict is: Glad I tried it.
