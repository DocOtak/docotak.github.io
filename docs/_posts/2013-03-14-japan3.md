Food
-------
Today I had a bunch of bread for breakfast, but not just any bread,
Japanese breads. I had three kinds, onion bread, some sort of shrimp
bread, and what is becoming my favorate, kare (curry) bread (I've had a
lot of curry here). I also ate at Mos Burger, mainly because I had heard
it was like McDonalds but with the Japanese quality. I simply had a
mosburger and some potato french fries. Later, I found some food trucks,
and, I can't resist food trucks, and these were food trucks IN JAPAN.
From them I had a Sweet Chili French Dog, which was very close to Puka
(now Hula) Dog in Waikiki.
