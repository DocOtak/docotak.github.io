<p>So I'm a bit late with this... but better late than never.<br &#47;>Every memorial day I go out to Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery where I place flags in front of grave markers. I have always placed flags in front of the same set of stones and even met the family of one of the people buried (not this year but previous years). They were happy to learn that I was the one who always made sure their father's (and grandfather's in the case of the kids) had a flag properly placed in font of his marker.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This year I noticed that the same marker had a new inscription on it, on reading it I realized that it was the wife of the man who was buried. I realized that I had met her, with her family, visiting her husbands grave. This year their grave received extra care.<br />
