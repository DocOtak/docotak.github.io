<p>On my last day of employment at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.biospherical.com&#47;">BSI<&#47;a> I set this up. You can't read the cards so I will list it from left to right.<br &#47;></p>
<ol>
<li>This is a peice of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Syntactic_foam">syntactic foam<&#47;a> that was put in a toaster oven to cure some filler that I had applied. As you can see, it caught fire.<&#47;li>
<li>The cable of shame was sent back from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov&#47;index.php">NASA<&#47;a> after it didn't work and possibly damaging the instrument<&#47;li>
<li>This was a refrence detector used in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Monochromator">monochromator<&#47;a>. It was dropped by not me. The person who dropped it knows who they are.<&#47;li>
<li>These are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Polytetrafluoroethylene">PTFE<&#47;a> spheres, due to a material defect, a large number of them are unusable. Not my fault.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br&#47;><br />
