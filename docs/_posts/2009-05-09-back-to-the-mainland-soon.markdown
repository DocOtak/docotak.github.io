<p>Much has happened since the last time I posted. 4 Finals, 1 Hike, and 1 awesome movie.<&#47;p>
<p>So my finals week started with what is probably the most intense hike on this island, which is to the summit of Konahuanui, a mountain that my school is under and just happens to be the highest peak in the Ko'olau range. It took 4 hours to get up and 4 hours to make the trip back down. But it was worth the time and effort as the views were spectacular.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26519&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26447&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;>At the top we were greeted by a friendly looking geological survey marker, this is the point that x marked on our maps.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26507&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;>There are actually two peaks and the journey just didn't seem complete if we didn't make it to the second (and higher) peak. To get there though, we needed to cross the ridge, less than a meter from the trail was a 300+ meter drop so we took it slow and steady (but safe). <br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26440&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;>A group photo is always in order...<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26513&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><&#47;p>
<p>After making it to the top of this mountain all of us who went felt that we could accomplish anything. Finals? no problem! We climbed a mountain! My finals started with a chemistry exam. The final exam in chemistry broke from the normal situation of the professor writing the exam, this test was an official examination from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;portal.acs.org&#47;portal&#47;acs&#47;corg&#47;content">ACS<&#47;a>. I felt that is was easier than the other exams I had it class, though it was comprehensive for the year, not just the semester.<&#47;p>
<p>The next exam was the final in Biology 2052, the second course in general biology. Just based on the numbers, I could not actually boost my grade by a letter grade by taking the final and earning 100%, since the final was optional, I didn't need to take it. But I did it anyway because I'm not one to not do something.<&#47;p>
<p>My last exam was in my basic oceanographic field techniques. Being a subject I was very familiar with before I took the class, I will confess that I didn't study for this exam. As irresponsible as that sounds, I didn't study for the midterm and got the highest grade in the class. I felt that this final went well, plus... I had Star Trek to look forward to.<&#47;p>
<p>After packing everything in my room, I was both ready to go to San Diego and, ready to go to see Star Trek, I'm going to say anything about this movie other than it's awesome and you should go see it, even if you don't like the Star Trek movies or series that came before this one. Just go see it.<&#47;p>
<p>Just 4 days from now I'm saying goodbye to the islands for a while. Off to San Diego and a summer job at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography!<br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26555&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew<&#47;p></p>
