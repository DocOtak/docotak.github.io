<p>Last Tuesday I went to see a "discussion" with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Freeman_Dyson">Freeman Dyson<&#47;a>, a rather well known theoretical physicist. While there he talked about a whole range of subjects from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Nuclear_physics">nuclear physics<&#47;a> to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Global_warming">global warming<&#47;a>, from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Quantum_mind">quantum consciousness<&#47;a> to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Relationship_between_religion_and_science">religion and science<&#47;a>. He had some interesting and often controversial ideas. Being the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ucsd.edu&#47;">University of California, San Diego<&#47;a>, I would imagine that the free exchange of ideas, especially the most controversial ones, would be highly encouraged. After sixty minutes of formal interview, there was a half hour period of open questions from the audience, then we were released to the courtyard for both refreshments and discussion. Very enlightening indeed. The recording that was made should be <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ucsd.tv&#47;search-details.aspx?showID=16939">available for viewing<&#47;a> sometime late August.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=27019&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>The internet keeps no secrets, and utilizing trial and error and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing<&#47;a>, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;KFC#The_secret_recipe">secret eleven herbs and spices<&#47;a> was reportedly discovered.
