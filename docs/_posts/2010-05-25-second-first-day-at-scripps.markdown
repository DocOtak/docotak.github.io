<p>I'm back!<br &#47;><br &#47;>Today was my second first day at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) in San Diego. I will be working at SIO for the summer while on holiday(?) from HPU. I will primarily be doing programing for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cchdo.ucsd.edu&#47;">CCHDO<&#47;a>. I'm just getting spun up on the specifics so more details to come. What I know for sure I'll be doing is producing at least one more video for the Virtual Cruise project and really cleaning up the code that drives the back end stuff. It was a bit rushed as I was leaving last summer to return to HPU. For now. Have some photos of the building I work in.<br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2010%3A-SIO-Summer-2&#47;IMG_0338.JPG?m=1274836911" height="375px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;>This is Isaacs Hall home to the CCHDO, Shipboard Technical Support (STS) and CDIP (there are some other people too).<br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2010%3A-SIO-Summer-2&#47;IMG_0339.JPG?m=1274836911" height="375px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;>It might be traditional to place pine cones in places around the building. I don't know who actually does is, but I have been known to "repair" pine cones that have fallen down.<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
