<p>HPU's annual talent show is coming up next week and it turns out that I'm in it! I will be playing solo piano during the show. Past performers have told me that it's more fun to be in the show than to watch it. To find out exactly what I will be playing you'll need to attend the show to find out... or there will probably be a recording of it posted on the internets somewhere. I will tell you that I'm playing a piece by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Joe_Hisaishi">Joe Hisaishi<&#47;a> and one by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;William_Bolcom">William Bolcom<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hpu.edu&#47;index.cfm?contentID=9821&siteID=1">HPU's Da FreakShow website<&#47;a> for details on when and where!<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
