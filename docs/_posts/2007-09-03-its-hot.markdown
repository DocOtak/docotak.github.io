San Diego is roasting right now, not as bad as last year, but still hot.
I went out to the desert on Friday to watch a meteor shower. On the way out I stopped in Alpine for dinner.
I had a shrimp and pesto pie (read as pizza).
It was good, although the amount of butter that was on it was excessive.
Almost as if they melted a whole stick and poured it on.
The crust was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork and knife.
While eating, the clouds rolled in and it started to flash, bang, crack, and rumble, although there was no rain.

The meteor shower was unimpressive. maybe it will be more awesome in 50 or so years when we see this particular shower again.

Also, Jeeps are awesome.
