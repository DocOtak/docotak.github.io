<p>Yesterday was Isaacs Hall Clean the Student Office Day. So actual work stopped and the office was cleaned out.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26989&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>It turned more into archeology than cleaning as various relics of past science programs were discovered (WOCE).<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26995&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Finding a stud to mount the surf board rack on...<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=27007&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>In other news, there have been strange happenings off the coast of La Jolla.
