Not the panet, the edit!
The [MarsEdit](https://ranchero.com/marsedit/), from the people who brought you such great hits as [NewsNetWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and um.... NewsNetWire Lite.
I'm just testing it out, see how I like it and such.
For all you who are reading from IE I'm still trying to figure out how to make this site look OK for you, tables had crossed my mind, but they suck.
Perhaps you should just get a [better browser](https://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), if you do, the web might stop sucking.
A links section will be up sometime, same with the photos, for now check out all the [robotics photos]()[^1].
It's still an "Untitled Document" might fix that eventualy. Aloha for now.
