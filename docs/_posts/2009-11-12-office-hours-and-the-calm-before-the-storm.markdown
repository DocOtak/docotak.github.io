<p>Every professor who has an office, and even some professors who don't have an office, have office hours. For those of you who don't know, office hours are when the professor is in their office and available to talk&#47;help&#47;tutor students like me (I'm wondering how many more times I can use the word 'office'). I've been meeting with my calculus professor regularly for some extra help and I got to tell you... it has paid off. It's always surprising to me how many people don't visit their professor when they need the extra help. Go visit them, that is why they are there!<br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;bin&#47;images&#47;historm.png"&#47;><br &#47;>Image from NOAA via Honolulu Advertiser<br &#47;>One thing that is never uninteresting about Hawaii to me is the weather. This morning the air was incredibly clear. However a quick look at the latest satellite photos told of something else looming on the horizon. The islands were circled in stormy clouds. A look at the animation showed the storm was building and eventually going to dump lots of rain... we'll see what happens later today, but I'm bringing my umbrella to class for sure.</p>
