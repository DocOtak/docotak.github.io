<p>So it was my birthday on Monday and with the connectedness of the facebook (and because it tells people when other people's birthdays are) people like to wish other people "Happy birthday" by writing on their wall. Curious as to how different that flurry of activity is from normal days, I plotted up some numbers:<br &#47;><br />
<table>
<tr>
<td>Ave. post&#47;day<&#47;td></p>
<td>0.10<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>ave gap between posts (days)<&#47;td></p>
<td>25<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>max gap between posts (days)<&#47;td></p>
<td>104<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>days where num posts >1<&#47;td></p>
<td>3<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Days where num posts = 1<&#47;td></p>
<td>11<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>total posts<&#47;td></p>
<td>36<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Birthday<&#47;td></p>
<td>21<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Other Days<&#47;td></p>
<td>15<&#47;td><br />
	<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;table><br &#47;><br />
As you can see most of the posts are on my birthday. In fact, the number of posts is larger than the statistical allowance for normal by almost 10 times. Just something to think about. Though I didn't actually run the numbers, the percentage of friends who posted was about 20%, not bad I guess.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I fly back to Hawaii on Monday!<br &#47;>-Andrew<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;blog&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;fb_wall_2010.png"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;blog&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;fb_wall_2010.png" alt="" title="fb_wall_2010" width="500" height="217" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-503" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
