<p>Last week I drove to San Jose from San Diego to pick my brother up from the school (college) he is attending. To make things even more insane I drove back on the same day. For those of you wondering about distance, that would be a whole 1500km total. I started at 0500 at made it to San Jose around 1300. I stopped in Gilroy to see if I could get a garlic braid, but they weren't available yet. After packing the car and eating at the famous <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.smoke-eaters.com&#47;">Smoke Eaters<&#47;a> we watched a film made by my brothers friends titled "Imposting Disbelief". After an 8 hour drive home, sleep. I will be driving back to San Jose on the 10th of next month.<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
