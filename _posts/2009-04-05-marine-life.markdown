<p>Margeaux, the RA from Mokihana, took the MCAT on Saturday, the Friday before she was super nervous, to relax she swam out to Flat Island in Kailua Bay, I went with her. On the way I was met with some interesting sea life.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26343&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;>I don't know what kinda of turtle that was, but it was quite speedy.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26363&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;>That looked like some kinda puffer fish to me. The fish didn't like me and would swim away from, instead of towards, me. There were also some big crabs on the island itself.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26348&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>I'm going to go look at my lab data now<br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
