<p>Today, a small coffee... stand, was my fooden place. Located in what would have been the lobby of the old Blaisdell Hotel, you may also know this as the location of the downtown student center (I don't know what it is called, Sharky is probably involved).<&#47;p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;4%3A-Jojo-Coffee&#47;IMG_0199.jpg" &#47;>
<p>It was also raining all crazy like, so I figured coffee would warm me up, I don't usually drink coffee otherwise.<&#47;p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;4%3A-Jojo-Coffee&#47;IMG_0200.jpg" &#47;>
<p>Coffee however was a mistake, I just ended up needing to visit the restroom frequently for the rest of the day, even needing to leave in the middle of a class to do so, something I really don't like doing.<&#47;p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;4%3A-Jojo-Coffee&#47;IMG_0201.jpg" &#47;>
<p>As for food, they pretty much had fruit tubs, at least, that is what was recommended to me, so that is what I got.<br &#47;>My Verdict: It's OK, if you like coffee.<br &#47;>Next Up: Ahi and Vegetable<&#47;p></p>
