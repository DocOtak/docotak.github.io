Today, a small coffee... stand, was my fooden place. 
Located in what would have been the lobby of the old Blaisdell Hotel, 
you may also know this as the location of the downtown student center 
(I don't know what it is called, Sharky is probably involved).

It was also raining all crazy like, so I figured coffee would warm me up, 
I don't usually drink coffee otherwise.

Coffee however was a mistake, I just ended up needing to visit the 
restroom frequently for the rest of the day, even needing to leave in 
the middle of a class to do so, something I really don't like doing.

As for food, they pretty much had fruit tubs, at least, that is what 
was recommended to me, so that is what I got.

My Verdict: It's OK, if you like coffee.
