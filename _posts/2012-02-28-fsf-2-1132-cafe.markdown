<p>This little shop is on the ground floor of 1132 Bishop Street in the middle of the makai hallway (that is the one the HPU bookstore is not on). I asked what was good and was recommended a club sandwich. So I did it, I mean, bacon. I'll just let the photos to the rest of the talking, cause I'm feeling lazy today.<&#47;p><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;2%3A-1132-Cafe&#47;IMG_0178.jpg" &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;2%3A-1132-Cafe&#47;IMG_0180.jpg?" &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2012%3A-Fort-Street-Mall-Food&#47;2%3A-1132-Cafe&#47;IMG_0185.jpg" &#47;><br &#47;>The sandwich was quite tasty, though, maybe in the future I won't have it toasted as the bread was a little dry for my taste.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Next up: Dreamers Cafe</p>
