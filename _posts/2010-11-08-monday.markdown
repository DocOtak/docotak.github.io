<p>I'm going to put the hiragana for the days of the week as I post this week in an attempt to help me remember them better. As I've said previous, I'm learning Japanese for the first time with little previous exposure.<br &#47;><br &#47;>On mondays, I have Japanese at 0955 at the downtown campus (I live at the Hawaii Loa Campus). My day today started way by catching the shuttle downtown at around 0830. I like to go early to get some work done before class. Japanese class is a lot of fun and I feel like I'm learning a lot, though I have trouble producing (I can understand much but can speak little). Right now in class we are doing self introductions (e.g. my name is, my home town is, my major is). I did my introduction today where I stod in front of the class (and sensei) and introduced myself in Japanese, I did ok, but sensei says I should be more confident.<br &#47;><br &#47;>After Japanese, I have about a 3 hour gap between calc 2. Durring this time I usually go to the library or the tutoring center (for Japanese). I have also been going to my math professors office hours, which I did today. There I got my midterm back, I did much better than I thought I would and to celebrate I decided to get a bento for lunch.<br&#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;CIMG1774.jpg?m=1289284713" &#47;><br &#47;>Math class is on the 9th floor of a building, as such, there is a rather good view of the area around the building. This is also the first nice sunny day in a weeks time. This next photo is looking toward the Wai?anae Mountain Range.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;CIMG1773.jpg?m=1289284711" &#47;><br &#47;>After math class I take the shuttle back to the Hawaii Loa Campus and then nap or play video games for the hour or so before dinner. After dinner I do homework (and write this). That was today, now, I have a lab report to finish.<br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
