<p>So it has been over a month since I last posted. I wasn't feeling good about school, and life in general. As such I had nothing positive to say about anything, so I didn't say it. I am enjoying most of my classes, though all of them are challenging. I am enjoying my Japanese class very much and hope that I can continue my studies next semester. While I'm finding it easier and easier to understand what is being said, I'm having a difficult time being able to produce. The tutors are are quite helpful with this though and I think, if I keep at it, I will eventually be able to speak the language as well as understand it. I've already learned hiragana and katakana, the latter of which is a lot of fun to know around Hawaii and the tourist areas especially as many of the signs are english words written in katakana. After being able to read the signs and menus around Waikiki, I get the impression that there is generally more information in the Japanese signs than the equivalent ones in english (I have found this especially true with restaurant menus). I'm going to try to make up for my missed time with some photos this week. Expect a new post and photo every day this week (I'll be carrying around a camera). I am planning on posting what "a typical week" is like, though there is a holiday on Thursday so there will be no photos about physics lab. I'll start off today with a photo of a giant tree on campus.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;Random%20Stuff&#47;giant_tree2.jpg?m=1289208434"&#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
