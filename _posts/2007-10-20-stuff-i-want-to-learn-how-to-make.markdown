<p><b>1. Coconut macaroons<&#47;b><br &#47;><br />
I just love these things.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p><b>2. Good gooey cinnamon rolls<&#47;b><br &#47;><br />
It's harder than you think to pull these off.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p><b>3. Falafel<&#47;b><br &#47;><br />
I tried once, they just fell apart.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p><b>4. Cookies<&#47;b><br &#47;><br />
Can't go wrong with cookies, not just chocolate chip, but all kinds.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>I'll add more when I think of more.</p>
