<p>Spring break is upon me, my first spring break in Hawaii and what will I be doing? Volunteering my time to help out with the local <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.robotics.hawaii.gov&#47;">FIRST Robotics Competition<&#47;a> regional here in Hawaii! I have helped my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;regional.sandiegorobotics.com&#47;">home town's competition<&#47;a> for 2 years now, but since I wasn't home this year for it, I can do what I can here.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This being the week before spring break, I had lots of midterms to occupy my time (hence the not posting for a while). A particularly awesome one was the MARS 1020 practical exam. We have 4 hours of boat time to use, but the practical only takes about an hour, so what do we do with the extra 3 hours? Go whale watching, that's what!<br &#47;><br &#47;>That thing is a whale, they tend to pop out of the water in unexpected location, so it can be hard to get a good photo of them.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26132&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Some of the awesome boat crew!<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26142&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>A friendly looking channel marker!<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=26147&g2_serialNumber=2"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>I'll have photos of the competition later next week.<br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
