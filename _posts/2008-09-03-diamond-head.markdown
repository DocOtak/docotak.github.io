  content: Your best pano to date, of those I've seen. The sky patched together nicely
    as is the composition. Only if the rail at the bottom didn't suffer from parallax
    error.

<p>Sorry for the break in photos, I've been busy. I'm all moved in to my residence hall. Which is named 'Ilima. Two nights ago almost the entire hall and some people from other halls were hanging out in the common area. I brought a digital piano up from the basement(where I live) and provided some musical entertainment. Classes have just started and so updates may be rare from here on. Here is a pano I shot from the top of Diamond Head (in Hawaii).<br> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=17079"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery&#47;main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=17080&g2_serialNumber=2"><&#47;a></p>
