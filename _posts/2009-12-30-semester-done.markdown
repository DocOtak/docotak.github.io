<div class="abpost">So the semester is finally over *and* I got my grades, without gettinf specific I did well. Apologies for the incredibly late post with finals then traveling and the distractions at home, I just wasn't thinking about posting. Well let's recap the semester in this for what I have to look forward to.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The semester started like any other so far, apprehension with excitement about the new courses I was taking. Lucky for me I was able to relax by catching a few waves.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009Surfing_Waikiki&#47;CIMG1556.jpg" height="330px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;> Of course the water wasn't the only place for weekend adventures. I also made it to the top of Olomana, a mountain not to far from the Windward campus and a prominent feature of the windward side of Oahu<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009_Olomana_1&#47;DSC_9600.jpg" height="330px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>As for academics I don't actually have much to "show" for it in the way of photos. The most exciting class was General Oceanography 1. The lab for this class frequently involved going offshore aboard R&#47;V Kaholo to obtain water or sediment samples (among other things). I have been informed that all the labs in this class will be offshore next semester. As such, I received a set of foul weather gear for Christmas. Although I can't talk about the specifics of the lab due to an NDA signed by me. I can say that learned a lot about the subjects of bathymetry, sediments, and hydrography. I'm looking forward to next semesters labs.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The last week before finals saw the arrival of waves on the north shore of Oahu the likes of which had not been seen for 5 years. This caused a good deal of absences from class. Instead of missing class I chose to venture to see the waves on a day when I did not have class.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009_Big_Surf&#47;DSC_0036.jpg" height="330px" width="500px"&#47;><br &#47;>It might be hard to tell but the streak on the wave is someone surfing it. The day after this photo was taken <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Quiksilver_Big_Wave_Invitational">The Eddie<&#47;a> was held at Waimea Bay. Though I did not get the chance to actually watch the competition by being there, it was conveniently streamed live on the internet. Waves, sadly, were not the discussion in the oceanography class, though they will be next semester (or so I'm told).<br &#47;><br &#47;>Looking forward to next semester I have a full load including: General Oceanography 2, General Oceanography 2 Lab, Communication, Biological Oceanography, and Cross Cultural Psychology. I will have classes at almost all the main campuses of HPU including: Hawaii Loa (Windward), Downtown, Oceanic Institute (Mokapu'u Point), and aboard R&#47;V Kaholo. I it will be a busy semester that is for sure.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I have a meeting with some people at SIO regarding the AGU Ocean Sciences meeting in Portland Oregon in 2010. Hopefully I'll have some (very good) news regarding it.<br &#47;>-Andrew<&#47;div></p>
