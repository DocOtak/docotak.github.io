<p>My summer in San Diego is over, I fly to Hawaii tomorrow (Monday). Much has happened this past week.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;IMG_0047.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Starting with the big oceanographic news, the research cruise to the north pacific gyre and the garbage patch that resides there. The cruise was called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sio.ucsd.edu&#47;Expeditions&#47;Seaplex&#47;">SEAPLEX<&#47;a> and was one of the first research cruises to the area. Last Thursday, the researchers had a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;hostednews&#47;ap&#47;article&#47;ALeqM5gdJqjFuqumNiDgkM1wyjZZHH4AfQD9ABJMG01">press conference<&#47;a> where they discussed their results. I was lucky enough to attend and listen to the researchers talk about what they found. Very interesting stuff, particulary about the discussion of another gyre in the Southern Pacific that is four times larger than the well known one in the north. Attending the conference was famous physical oceanographer <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Walter_Munk">Walter Munk<&#47;a>, student of the even more famous (in oceanography) <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Harald_Ulrik_Sverdrup">Harald Sverdup<&#47;a>. I introduced myself to him, but there was little time for talk before the conference started.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Friday was my last day working at SIO for the summer. During my time there I worked with an incredible group of people, especially undergraduate students like myself.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;DSC_9508.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;>From left to right: Dr. James Swift (Jim) the PI of the group I worked for, Carolina Berys a former student now full time employee, Jessicah Morison a very talented data forensics analyst, Andrew Barna (me), Matthew Shen a skilled programer and cellist, Roxanne Lee a talented graphic design artist. Matthew, the programer cellist, would occasionally come over to the place I was living and we would play music, him on cello, me on piano.<br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;IMG_0042.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>On Friday, I finally asked for a tour of the lab I had been working above for the last few months. Jim, after expressing surprise that he hadn't given me one earlier, was more than happy to lead the tour. In the labs I saw all sorts of instrumentation and calibration equipment. <br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;DSC_9563.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;>Above is the nutrient auto analyzer. Which uses a color based method for determining the concentration of various nutrients in the water.<br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;DSC_9570.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.andrewbarna.org&#47;photos&#47;gallery3&#47;var&#47;resizes&#47;2009SIO&#47;DSC_9569.jpg" width="500px" height="330px"&#47;><br &#47;>The first images shows the sample rosette with niskin bottles mounted on them, these are also referred to as CTDs though no instrumentation was mounted to them at the time of the photograph. The lower photo is of Jim holding what all HPU marine science students will learn about, an actual niskin bottle.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I board the plane and depart San Diego tomorrow, before I go, I'll be getting one last burrito...<br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
