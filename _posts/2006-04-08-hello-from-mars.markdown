<p>Not the panet, the edit! The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ranchero.com&#47;marsedit&#47;">MarsEdit<&#47;a>, from the people who brought you such great hits as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ranchero.com&#47;netnewswire&#47;">NewsNetWire<&#47;a> and um.... NewsNetWire Lite. I'm just testing it out, see how I like it and such. For all you who are reading from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;windows&#47;ie&#47;default.mspx">IE<&#47;a> I'm still trying to figure out how to make this site look OK for you, tables had crossed my mind, but they suck. Perhaps you should just get a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.com&#47;firefox&#47;">better browser<&#47;a>, if you do, the web might stop sucking. A links section will be up sometime, same with the photos, for now check out all the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;students.hightechhigh.org&#47;~abarna&#47;photos&#47;Robotics&#47;index.nav.html">robotics photos<&#47;a>. It's still an "Untitled Document" might fix that eventualy. Aloha for now.</p>
