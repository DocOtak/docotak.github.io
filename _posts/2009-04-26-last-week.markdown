<p>This upcoming week is my last week of school before finals week which means everything is due sometime this week, a paper in writing, my various lab practicals, little bits of homework for various classes, all of this before finals week. But what am I doing today? going to the north shore as part of my RA's program. So I'm off to the beach!<br &#47;><br &#47;>-Andrew</p>
